> a database of registrant encrypted
  * the file is in encrypted format
  * there is a filter that encrypts and decrypts
  * display is plain text
  * output is plain text in screen
  * BUT everything is written to file, searched, compared in encrypted form
  * OR in-memory decryption is done on the fly and then compared to search 
    string:
    (read record, decrypt, compare, process results 
    [keep tab of record id if needed and comment?])
  * It seems weird or process intensive, but decrypting and then keeping an in 
    memory tab of the search result will make sure no plain text data is writte
    to file. 'Plain text form' is only done in processing or output to human 
    user, otherwise it is all encrypted.
  * Would an in-memory plain text decrypted DB be the answer or just run through
    the whole DB per process and just edit DB per record as needed? - Maybe jus
    as needed.
