        I will log everything I did in this file. This entry will be the main 
page and all other entries will be from the newest to the oldest. If my goals
change then the main page will also change. Minimize size of main pages.

        I am creating a development machine from scratch using BSD, OpenBSD in 
this case. I plan to have a good configuration for vim, Python and C development 
for my needs. I need to be able to run my scheduling scripts from this machine. 
I need internet from LAN at least and from wifi optimally. It would be nice to 
have a nice working Gnome window manager if ever. Or I will just use tmux as my 
window manager.

        Needed: 
        * vim
        * good vim configuration
        * letter count in vim
        * syntax highlighting in vim
        * git?
        * internet connection           - fw_update and ifconfig solved this
        * file transfer 

        If not, I will write all my tools from scratch in C and in shell script. 
        Maybe this is what I will do.
        * No internet by default.
        * No emails
        * No browser
        * Just vim 
        * STUDY SOURCECODE
        * Write my own tools from scratch, even command line tools.
        * Try to use only what is in the default install plus vim and git!

    How do I get rid of the ugly green h-line in emacs when run in terminal or
    terminator? I need fullscreen or something like that which would have split
    panes with editor(s) and at least one terminal.

    Now if I could only find a solution, it would really make life much better.

    It would actually make life the best!

    Having multiple terminals filling up the screen is how I am working right
    now. Gives me a view of four things that I may be working at once. Not using
    tmux for now as I am using emacs and tmux changes the look (font, background
    and highlighting. Spacemacs is a comfortable and pleasing environment to
    work on. I've got some basic shortcuts down and the vim bindings for editing
    just work. Quite a workable setup.
    Installing spacemacs just involved installing a newer version of emacs and
    then just downloading the spacemacs configuration:

    $ git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d

    Then on first run, spacemacs asks for defaults. I chose the vim bindings
    with it and then it just works!

        void (*ret) () = (void(*)()) code;
        ret();
        // ( *( void( * ) ()) code) ();
    }

    compile with:

    $ gcc -z execstack test_shellcode.c -o test_shellcode

    Using pry:

    $ pry

    pry(main)> s="something"
    pry(main)> show-doc s 

    pry(main)> ls 

    Can use 'ls', 'cd', 'gem-cd'
    'nesting' shows where you are: use '..' to get out of that context

    Adding shell command output to buffer in spacemacs:

    SPC-u SPC-! [shell command]

    In emacs it is

    C-u M-x ! [shell command]

    But C-u does not work in my installation of spacemacs.

    Studying snippets from the book "The Practice of Programming" by Kernigan
    and Pike. Had trouble making lookup function work, but finally did:

    int lookup (char *word, char *array[]) {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; array[i] != NULL; i++) {
            if (strcmp (word, array[i]) == 0) {
               return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    use like:

    char *flab[] = {"something", "another", "aword", NULL}; // NULL terminate
    int found = lookup (word, flab);

    Emacs/spacemacs is really working out right now. I do not care for learning
    too much new editing keys. I just like the font, the background and the
    directory opening. So far it works for me. Let us see more what will happen.

    Eye candy is winning me over.

    And org mode in emacs look very slick.

================================================================================

Wed Dec 14 07:36:16 EST 2016

    Starting emacs in terminal (no window):

    $ emacs -nw

    I am a little bit getting the hang of using spacemacs. My vim keys work (the
    little that I know). I like the screen contrast and the font itself which is
    very comfortable. This itself is a reason enough to learn some emacs and
    keep my old keybindings. Opening files is also easy with spacemacs:

    SPC - f - j

    which opens dired and you can navigate with 'kl' vim navigation keys.

    Also this same display is consistent in my FreeBSD remote server which has
    I log into with ssh.

    Things I need to figure out:
    > inserting shell command output in current buffer (like date)
    > adjusting shiftwidth/tabstop to 4 characters
    > better autocomplete for C code.

    And I can even split windows easily with SPC - w - and then navigate windows
    with vim keybindings (Ctrl-w [hjkl]). Sold!

    Another caveat. The contrast and line highlight changes if emacs is run
    under tmux.

================================================================================

Tue Dec 13 23:19:16 EST 2016

    Disable syntax hightlighting in emacs:

    M-x font-lock-mode

    Print date and time on current emacs buffer (write shell command result):

    C-u M-! [command]

    I have been delving into assembly language this week since middle of the
    week. Bought the book HTAOE (Hacking the Art of Exploitation). It has some
    examples of disassembling programs in gdb. A lot of C coding. Back to basics
    and really studying how it all works. Sweet! This seems to be worth at least
    a month's study in itself.

    Started with a tutorial in asm compiling with "as", but got go find one in
    "nasm". Tried coding in Linux and FreeBSD. The linux sample puts values in
    registers (edx, ecx, ebx) and FreeBSD sample does "push dword val" right 
    away. Both call 'mov eax, syscall' and then 'int 0x80' to call kernell.
    The '.data' section both have the strings "stringname db 'the string'".

    Here is an example code (any text proceeding ';' are ignored)

; hello.asm
; compile with:
; nasm -f elf hello.asm (add -g option for debug)
; ld -m elf_i386 -s -o hello hello.o (remove -s option for debug)

section .data
    msg db 'Hello ,world na!', 0xa ; string to be printed
    len equ $-msg
section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov     edx, len
    mov     ecx, msg
    mov     ebx, 1      ; file descriptor for stdout is 1
    mov     eax, 4      ; system call (write)
    int     80h         ; call kernel  "int 0x80" (would work too)

    mov     eax, 1      ; sytem call (exit)
    int     0x80

    Coming to think of it. If I have a weekend available, I might consider 
    hosting a text blog on a FreeBSD server... Hosted on a cheaper host (below
    $10) monthly.
    Got to go back to zeromq and C coding the rc4 thing.

================================================================================

Thu Nov 17 23:06:23 EST 2016

    I will put down firewall and tcpdump tinkering for now and go back to 
    writing and coding every day. That was a nice off time, but have to keep
    focused on what I do though... Which are coding, writing and living a full
    life. I almost shutdown my linode account for an NQ hosting as I was really
    intrigued by an article regarding Linux or FreeBSD servers. But, I know that
    after getting the server up, I am not the type to keep asking support. Or
    maybe it will be worth it. Anyway, FreeBSD on a laptop, Linux on my main
    machine and may switch to FreeBSD hosting as soon as I figure out the 
    payment method I want to do. I just feel that I don't want to spend time at
    this time learning how to keep another new server, now in FreeBSD, can be
    kept secure without eating up my whole nights - sleep is also another thing
    I value these times.
    
================================================================================

Thu Nov 17 22:48:43 EST 2016
    
    And oh, I forgot to mention - I just ditched my OpenBSD installation... Just
    did it a couple of days ago. Replacing it is FreeBSD. I decided on FreeBSD
    due to an itch to play with firewalls, namely IPFW, but did not go too deep
    into it. It took me three installation tries with FreeBSD excluding trying
    to find the correct BSD image for my machine and writing the image on a USB
    stick. I first wrote the image from windows, but I had used a 64-bit image,
    forgetting that I had an old machine. Downloaded the i386 one and wrote it
    again from windows a couple of times but this time the usb stick would not
    boot properly. Considered using my Mac to write the image but that would
    again entail "researching" the right commands... Maybe it is in this file 
    though... Yes it is here somewhere, but to save on time (which is a very
    important commodity nowadays to be able to enjoy life more), I decided to
    just write the image with "dd" in Linux... And it worked like a charm. Sort
    of. 

    What happened next was 3 installation tries. As being the impatient me, I
    would move my laptop around while the installation was going on and then an
    error would occur. I understood this so the third time, I did not move the
    laptop during the install process at all (I had the thought that some 
    laptops are build like superman). But I did have a couple of surprises 
    with this FreeBSD install.

    > The startup screen had nice contrasting fonts in white/gray.
    > Wifi was configured during install without a hitch.
    > Close the laptop lid, open it again and everything works again, even
      wifi.
    > The installation fit the 40 gig hardrive easily - 8% used only even after
      tmux, vim, python, ruby and all other dependencies were installed.
    > Vim has the "dropdown" list for intellisense.
    > Vim has the C lib tagged already.
    > Running a couple of days without restarts, although I do close the lid...
    > Easy to install software. 
    > Just works fine.

    I have now installed Linux (Ubuntu distro) on my Lenovo Thinkpad. Instead of
    trying to buy a Raspberry Pi or use my Mac as the development machine/server
    it was easy to just use one of the partitions in my Lenovo as the Ubuntu
    drive...

    Anyway, for zeromq which I have been struggling with for 2 days and not
    being able to code much because of just trying to configure it to run in
    gcc tdm in windows, cygwin on windows or even a visual studio project which
    was the only one that compiled, but crashed anyway. No more of that
    nonsense!

    Downloaded Posix sources for zeromq, untarred, ./configure, make, make
    install and whala! It is running.

    I even have vim running, git now setup with keys of this machine for my 
    github page, vimrc updated from my Windows setup and enjoying coding without
    syntax highlighting.

    Now back to that snippet. One snippet a day at least...

    I was off on Monday so I was able to figure out how to setup and code basic
    things in SDL. I was just at the library before dinner and read advice 
    somewhere saying that you should just code all the time - or it was put as
    don't stop coding. It is the way to be continually able to fluently code.
    It did not say read, study or copy code. Just write code.

    Everyday I have to code. If I want to code something that I do not know how
    to then I will read a little and try to code it myself again, until I have
    a solution. These should then be just small snippets to be doeable and not
    too difficult as to get me stuck in coding paralysis.

    Code I used, structured with C++ style structures (different from C as the
    C++ struct can have methods). This is a style I got from Bisqwit -

    set up. Could not make it link properly using TDM Gcc toolset for Unix like
    gcc and the like. Spent almost an hour and kept looking through google. I
    even connected to the irc channel and maybe muster the courage to ask, but
    never did. Not even familiar enough of irc etiquette. Gave up and then 
    decided to try SDL. 
    This tutorial helped me with the setup:

    http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/mingw/index.php

    The compile command used was:

    g++ 01_hello_SDL.cpp -IC:\mingw_dev_lib\include\SDL2
    -LC:\mingw_dev_lib\lib -w -Wl,-subsystem,windows -lmingw32 -lSDL2main
    -lSDL2 -o 01_hello_SDL

    But that did not work for me so I used this one: 


    g++ board.cpp   \
    -IC:\cygwin64\home\coder\libs\SDL2-2.0.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2 \
    -LC:\cygwin64\home\coder\libs\SDL2-2.0.5\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib -w       \
    -Wl,-subsystem,windows -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -o board

    Of course I used different paths for includes and libraries.

    The sample code in the site did crash though, although it did compile and 
    run.
    
    Code to follow...

    I opened my old Macbook last night and charged it after doing a little bit 
    of late night surfing. I've destroyed the USB wireless from use as it jutt
    out a little bit to the side of the mac, but miraculously, the wireless is
    now working again. I put it in a corner of the room turned of and when I
    started it, it just did and still a fast boot time. My main machine now is
    this Lenovo Thinkpad T450s with Cygwin installed as I got tired of using
    Windows command line tools. Unix like always works.

    Fullscreen iTerm with vim just looks much better. Keyboard is not like the 
    Thinkpad, but also very good - both are. Got to fix that part of it - fonts
    and even the colorscheme. But still, the Macbook for development kicks ass.

    Fullscreen iTerm in the Mac though is distraction free.    

    I just bought the Lenovo as it was getting harder to install newer software
    on my old Mac.

    I can't believe how slow my machine runs Go programs for the first time. A
    simple "hello world" application actually took about 10 seconds to start and
    print. A similar program in C took less than a second to compile and then
    even less to run. Even a similar program in Ruby took about to a second or
    less to run. 

    Why?

    I am using Cygwin under windows right now, but I have had the same problem
    in my Go installation in Windows. I used Visual Studio "cl" for C and the
    Ruby installation from ruby-lang.org. In Cygwin, Go, gcc, and Ruby were all
    installed by default (I did check a few more options during the install
    process).

    This is the reason why I left Go. I know, I may seem to be such a demanding
    programmer. But, I program only in my free time to "relax" myself. I like
    using console tools. I do like to idea of Go being able to compile it and it
    has a lot of things going for it like much simpler syntax than C, easy net-
    working, concurrency, go tools... Not to mention built by Rob Pike and Ken
    Thompson.

    I have to say though that after the first run or compile, the Go program 
    runs much faster. In my Mac installation it also is a little bit faster
    even on the first run.

    But here is the thing. When I develop, I edit in vim, save, Ctrl-z and then
    compile/run program and see if there is any problem or feature I want to add
    then go back to vim "fg". So the first run could be the only execution for
    that version of my program. 10 seconds seems like a very, very long time to
    wait for the program to run. Being a mortal, I may have even lost my train
    of thought already. Whereas even if it is a C compilation, I just need to 
    use the arrow keys for bash history (even windows console has this) for the
    compilation and execution commands which both take a split second, even
    feels instantaneous which I find really cool. It's like my computer saying -
    "Master I am here to serve you. I will drop doing anything to do your
    command." I guess I just want to be in control when I program and do not
    want to be kept waiting. 

    Another thing was it with the default Vim install, Go code formatting and
    syntax highlighting is not my favorite. C tops the list of being formatted
    by Vim nicely in plain vim installs with the least amount of tweaking.

    I know there are better ways to tweak my installation, but I just want my
    tools to run, and run fast.

================================================================================

Wed May 25 20:37:45 EDT 2016

        I was about to stop using Emacs and go back to Vim/Tmux which is what I am
        using right now while writing this entry in my linode instance, then I just
        decided to tinker around with Ruby having seen the blog entry: 

    http://solnic.eu/2016/05/22/my-time-with-rails-is-up.html

        That blog entry made me wonder again about Ruby as Merb was mentioned and 
        how many developers got excited about using a lightweight framework for
        development. This stirred also some interest in me. What is happening in the
        Ruby dev community? What is new? What are people getting excited about. I'm
        still keeping away from Javascript. Trying to develop something fast with 
        something not Python. Maybe in Go but not yet too skilled in Go. Ruby though
        is relatively easy, I like closing scope by "end" and not just indentation,
        and I did have some experience developing in it already. Why not give it a
        try again?

        So I installed Ruby in my Win machine. Installing easy. Now what web frame-
        work? Read some documentation. Only Sinatra won. Done. 
        
        gem install sinatra

        Then when I tried coding the source in vim, indentation was funky....
        Tried Emacs in evil-mode. Indentation good. Font good. Finding files -
        better than Vim. Emacs-evil-mode wins!

    TWITTER_VOTES PART 3

    So I downloaded nsq binaries from http://nsq.io/deployment/installing.html

    $ sudo cp * /usr/local/bin

    Now these two both work!

    $  nsqlookupd

    My mongo is still not working. I plan to use either redis or sqlite for this

    Now let's get the go driver for nsq:

    $ go get github.com/bitly/go-nsq

    Now my problem is MongoDB does not install in my old macbook. I will just

    I do agree that emacs is a very good programming environment with lots of 
    stuff to make programming productive, but... I am just in a hurry to finish
    the Python script I needed to parse files. The old program used a database
    and I decided that this time, I would go with as little "dependencies". And
    the script just reads an excel file and then prints it out with data sorted
    out. It was a pain trying to think of the code, the problem in the
    algorithm and the use of a new text editor. 

    I just wanted to give emacs a try as I am programming in Windows to be able
    to extract the data from a windows program.

    Even moving text, even typing speed was affected. At this time, I am in a
    crunch. Can think faster with the current setup. Can code faster with the 
    current setup. Familiarity of the coding environment and language. 

    I still plan to study emacs and its code though, including lisp.

    At this time, vim and python - I am fastest this way.

    USE LESS CODE MORE (using less libraries, tools and frameworks work)

    It saves time and energy learning a new framework.
    It saves time, energy and motivation to not get into bugs and configuration
    hell from using unfamiliar or unstable libraries, frameworks.
    Not using ORM to cut down on studying the ORM or configuration and then I
    end up just testing the basic functionality of the models (CRUD).
    Now I just code the functionality I need directly. I do not have the time to
    be a framework expert.

    USE MORE ONLY WHEN IT HELPS.

    Example is I use an python library for reading excel files with a very easy
    api. Not too powerful but understandable.

    > TV on with something not too interesting (Action series).
    > Sit and stand.
    > Workout.
    > "Easy" testing. Combination of py.test and just manually checking program
      output. Testing is not formalized.
    > Used python as I am familiar (get around my head), setup was easy, 
      libraries - did not have to read up much to code. Fairly powerful, not too
      low level that you have to code everything yourself and did not have the
      "configuration hell" with some languages. Readily available in Unix like
      and windows easily.

    This setup works. Last night I was able to code the script that will compare
    two files and print out what entries have not yet been done based on the 
    older (marked) file. Saves me time and a lot of brain cycles at work.

    My new workflow/setup.

    Using my Lenovo Thinkpad 450s exclusively. Using my Macbook as a backup and
    unix based programming environment. I just turn the Mac on and connect to it
    via ssh. Using Putty and adjusted screen fonts to Lucida Console 14 pt - way
    better to have large fonts. My raspberry pi is always on and I connect to it
    for backup and maybe work on C programming. Currently programming in Python
    in my Thinkpad. Downloading Microsoft Visual Studio for C programming. I
    found a tip in "Handmade Hero" video for setting up and console based 
    environment for C/C++ development.

    Music       : Metal, definitely for programming.
    Text editor : vim/gvim with larger fonts and dark backround.
    Browser     : Firefox
    Console     : cmd with larger fonts
    Python      : using py.test (painless testing)
    programming : "data driven" - just basically testing code against real data
                  and making sure that output is correct. That simple.

    Monday and Wednesday I was not able to do much of coding or workouts, 
    although I was able to play a little tennis with Janjan in the Kinderhook
    tennis area last yesterday, Tuesday. Caught up with work in Barnwell and 
    also with my homecare. I think it is a good idea to devote Sunday PM, Mon-
    day AM until Tuesday to play catch up and get ahead. Then the rest of the
    week would be doable. Get ahead of the game. So I have not been getting too
    much sleep Sunday nights and get to sleep better on Monday. I think this
    makes sense for me as for so many years in College, I had to travel from
    Bohol to Cebu (4 hour boat trip) on Sunday night and then sometimes even
    had to miss some of Monday... That was not a good idea and it was so lone-
    ly. 
    But doing it this way:
    > Get all loose ends done and get ahead of work Sunday PM and Monday am,
      power through Monday 
    
    I use my energy and still be with family. And it is getting ahead, not 
    being behind. I also am able to just make it through Monday as it is mostly
    dreary anyway. No more Sunday night boat trip which was one of the least
    pleasant memories of my College and Cebu working days. 


    Sunday - Family and most workout then catchup on all notes.
    Monday - least workouts and get ahead of work.

    Sunday 6 PM and up seems to be "my time". I feel that I can tackle stuff
    like coding, reading, working out and even writing notes for my homecare PT
    stuff. I seem to be "available" at this time. It is also good or everyone to
    be home at this time so they can tackle the coming week's challenges. I like
    to "frontload" my work - I even used to go very early to work on Monday 
    6:30 AM to do scheduling or even do it Sunday nights at my daytime PT work.
    Yes, Sunday night or Monday early mornings were spent there. For about 2
    years of my life.  (Continued at my journal page....). Anyway, if I could do
    it for work, I could do it for myself....

    Sunday just a little bit after 7 PM. Church at 10:30 AM done. Cooked for 
    family lunch done. Time with family and a couple of friends and then had a
    little nap. Decided to get some coffee a while ago, although I have decided
    to cut on coffee and alcohol for most of the week. Sundays are always the 
    exception. Now the plan:
    * Read
    * Workout
    * Code
    * Write on journal
    * Write PT notes

    Mind is relatively clear. And a little while before this, just did a ritual:
    cleaned coffee pot and water dispenser - took about 10 minutes. That was my
    meditation. Also put all my Homecare scheduled visits in my Google calendar.
    Also some plans for this week. Now I feel that I have planned. Nowadays too
    I finish all my dayjob notes on time since I do not have the scheduling duty
    already. Now just the MDS to be on time. I need to write that tool to merge
    MDS lists and mark what are done and not done (will save me about 30 minutes
    every day and that will be my morning time which is very important for me).

    I am sold: totally going to shop for a Macbook air soon.

FROM freethink.txt:

Time to code:
  Best would be early in the morning.

Best machine for coding.
  (mac)

What can I say? Typing in my Macbook is
  FREAKING AWESOME!!
  I would not have any other machine at
    this point to type on...
  Nor do I have one comparable...

Why is the Macbook awesome:
  Still has some battery. (2-3 hours)
  Keyboard rocks
  Very good "sleep" functionality.
  Just works.

(Taken from my journal entry)

    As I thought, I can program most productively in my Macbook. Planning to buy
    either a Macbook 11" or an HP Elitebook 12". Elitebook has bigger memory and
    costs about $300, Macbook Air a minimum of $460. Elitebook 12", Macbook Air
    11". Macbook has good keyboard, Elitebook might have good keyboard.
    Macbook has OSX, Elitebook has Windows (I would have to install linux). 
    Macbook should have good battery life, Elitebook about 3 hours. Macbook has
    good sleep function, Elitebook depends on linux. Macbook will be easy to 
    connect to network and has good PDF readers. Elitebook...

    Macbook Air 11", wins even with price. I better buy a good almost like new
    or new one (OLD version or newest).

    Macbook Air 11" wins!

    John Carmack when Id was in full scale development and when they just 
    started having money, once went out on a cold day, drove his car to for a
    bit and came back with a Next Cube. It was his investment. Back then the
    Next Cube cost about $10,000. That was about 20 years ago. John Carmack
    coded the game Wolfenstein and Tim Berners Lee used a Next Computer to 
    "build" the internet. Cool STUFF! Macbook Air wins in my game.
    
    Now to look for stickers for my Mac.

    The tools, the language and the workflow.

    I think that when programming, it is not only the language itself that makes
    it fun and productive but also the tools available and the workflow... I 
    like tools that are simple and that I know how to use. I do not like to 
    install a library/plugin and then later on it does not run (like the
    nightmare I had with Ruby gems and versions). I did not know why there had
    to be so many dependencies and then later on they were broken.

    Anyway, the workflow. I will describe mine for this short snippet that did 
    not work (after I added the scaffolding code):

        #include <time.h> 
        char *now; 
        char *date; 
        /* original snippet starts here */
        time(&now);
        strcpy(date, ctime(&now));
        date[strlen(date)-1] = '\0';
        /* original snippet ends here */

    So the workflow:
    1. save file after editing (using vim ":w")
    2. Ctrl-z to get out of vim temporarily
    3. gcc -Wall the_art.c -o the_art
    4. ./the_art (runs the program)
    5. fg
    6. back to 1

    Steps 3 and 4 I do not have to type, just use the "up" arrow for command
    history.

    It had bugs so did not compile yet. Fixed bugs. I ran then had segmentation
    fault. I decided to use Valgrind to be safe. Oh, my Mac does not have 
    valgrind. Easy, I have a raspberry pi always on with gcc, valgrind, python
    and some other good stuff (like vi with tags to C library code).

    scp *.c pi@192.168.0.xx://home/pi/projects/c_snippets

    Used steps 1 - 6 but changed 3 and 4 to use valgrind as follows:

    3. gcc -Wall -g the_art.c -o the_art
    4. valgrind ./the_art

    Kept doing the same routine, until I found a solution.
    It takes just a couple of seconds to save(":w"), get out of vim("Ctrl-z")
    and compile (2-3 up arrows).

    I currently reading "The Practice of Programming" by Kernigan and Pike, and
    find that their are a few bits of of essential tips for programmers and 
    especially for C programmers. Going through some code about commenting your
    code, I found a snippet that resulted in a segmentation fault. It compiled
    but the segmentation fault happened when I ran the code (more aoubt this 
    later). But I was able to hack a bit and experimented. Used Valgrind and
    hacking away and read a little bit of the man pages and whalla! It ran...

    TPOP has good idioms for C and other languages and a very good regex matcher
    in a few lines of C.

    fread in C when reading binary files in unix is different when using it in
    Windows. I opened the file using:


        conn->file = fopen(filename, "r+");

    This link 
    (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11717120/unexpected-return-value-from-fread)
    suggests that fopen be used with "rb" flag

        conn->file = fopen(filename, "rb+");

    I will give it a try later, but I am also thinking about using mingw on
    windows. I just tried TCC last night.

    My little side project is a database that uses structs and write the structs
    (and read them) in binary format.

    Or I may have to read and write to text files instead, as this may work for
    my other little project which will parse MDS lists and determine which were
    done and not done - this tool I need badly.

    This weekend, I was not able to code my planned dayprog planner database,
    but I had fun with pcap capture library.

    Had pcap installed and running on my raspberry pi by Saturday morning. Had
    it running in OSX later on. Followed the tutorial in: 
    http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html

    Took it slow. Bit by bit. First compiled with #include <pcap.h>. Then 
    slowly added functionality. Had visitors saturday afternoon to night so I
    had a coding stop for a bit but coded again a little more Saturday night.

    Saturday morning more done, afternoon for 2 hours and then finished the
    whole thing at 10:30 PM tonight after my run.

    Got it done!

    From now on, a tutorial should be done in due time. I will not hurry at all
    as I will not learn much that way. It was about a 300 + line program with
    lots of comments for the functions used. Coded in C. Followed the tutorial,
    but I think I still have to revisit this and code more my own.

    It had a callback function which called printing functions in hex and ascii.
    
    Totally rocks!

================================================================================

Sun Jan 31 22:35:49 EST 2016

    Packet capture code using libpcap is working. Nice! Learning more C idioms.
    The little sniffer program was written in good style. Uses pointer offset
    locations. 
    
    Has callback function. Cool!

    Code is in ~/projects/packet/sniff.c

    The function:
    
    int pcap_loop(pcap_t *p, int cnt, pcap_handler callback, u_char *user)

    this is the key to the callback mechanism. So each time a packet is read,
    the callback function "callback" is called with arguments.

================================================================================

Sun Jan 31 15:00:38 EST 2016

    Studying code by typing it in and modifying (one way to learn, a good one).

    I have been coding the sniffer in C for a couple of hours now. About 250
    lines with comments explaining some parts of the program. So it could be
    about 200 lines. I had also some code in there from past pcap library use
    practice snippets. So it could be close to 150 lines of code. 

    Now, this is just trying to copy and get to understand the sniffer code in
    C. 

    Method:
    1. copy a small part of the code (about 1 to 5 lines only)
    2. compile/run
    3. understand the code

    4. edit code if needed to fit my liking

    This will be my defacto standard of studying C code from now on...

    Taken from my journal with the above date and time:

    I should be writing more on my journal. I have been writing a bit on my BSD
    notes though. I think is it good to look at my git logs to know home much
    I have been "working". Right now, notes and some projects have been tracked,
    but my "projects folder has not been....". Maybe I should log all the 
    "creative" work I have done and the "freewriting" too. Hmm. just a thought.

    Anyway, looking into doing "go" or "c". Learning to have a rudimentary 
    database in C. Porting to go or not? Go has encryption, go routines, and
    networking with it. I have also found a bare tcp server an client sample.
    Trying to figure out patterns for file access. Maybe I should look into
    the simple go database implementation with JSON serialization sample and
    then just change it to the c-style implementation ..... Hmmm. Time to look
    into some code.

    I am trying out small project samples from other people. Might try to read
    on medium sized samples later on... But I feel I still have the need to 
    be grounded on the small snippets of code which I do enjoy doing. I shall
    do this and maybe bigger projects later on. 0MQ was good for a while then
    things got complex. I'll go back to 0mq and nanomsg later on when I need
    a networking stack for my database maybe. Maybe that is....

    ZeroMQ is really pulling me into programming programs that I find really
    cool. Messaging across machines, client and server, publish and subscribe.
    These are what I like. Coded in C. Even the ZeroMQ style of coding really
    makes sense. Instead of using function pointers and structs to have some-
    thing like classlike behaviour, 0mq just uses naming conventions and passes
    pointers to structs, like:

    void *context = zmq_ctx_new();
    void *requester = zmq_socket(context, ZMQ_REQ);
    // here's a sample:
    zmq_connect(requester, "tcp://localhost:5555");
    // another:
    char buffer[10];
    zmq_send(requester, "Hello", 5, 0);
    zmq_recv(requester, buffer, 10, 0);
    zmq_close(requester);
    zmq_ctx_destroy(context);
    
    How cool is that!

    After unsuccessfully trying to install zeromq and having a lot of libsodium
    library not found problems when building zeromq, I almost gave up on it, 
    until I just did:

    $ brew install zeromq

    ==> Downloading http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-4.1.2.tar.gz
    ######################################################################## 100.0%
    ==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/zeromq/4.1.2 --without-libsodium
    ==> make
    ==> make install
    /usr/local/Cellar/zeromq/4.1.2: 63 files, 3.3M, built in 107 seconds

    Found it from here: 
    http://cbcg.net/blog/2011/07/30/getting-zeromq-and-jzmq-running-on-mac-os-x/

    Cloned my distributed applications testbed into ~/projects/distributed and
    compiled like this:

    $ gcc hello_client.c -L/usr/local/Cellar/zeromq/4.1.2/lib/ -lzmq -o hello_client

    $ ls /usr/local/Cellar/zeromq/4.1.2/lib/

    libzmq.5.dylib
    libzmq.a
    libzmq.dylib
    pkgconfig

    I guess -L prefix points to the "lib/" folder which contains libzmq.a
    which is used by the -l prefix of gcc.

    Rock on...

    Coded before breakfast and a little bit more after breakfast trying out
    zero mq. This is the sort of programming I like! Sockets, client-server,
    publish - subscribe. Makes the blood go uhm.

    weather_updater.c is a program that just publishes mock weather data. I 
    tried modifying py_hags/tcp_client.py to listen to port 5556 where it 
    publishes, but got "garbled" data. Telnet sort of does the same thing:

    $ telnet 192.168.0.11 5556 > response.txt

    Tweaked distributed/src/weather_client.c to print out every single 
    weather data sent as it is received.

    All working on my raspberry pi.

    Uploaded to git.

    Hello 0mq !

    Built libsodium and zero mq:

    (https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/scalable-c/content/chapter1.html)

    cd $HOME/projects

    # Install libsodium
    git clone https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
    cd libsodium
    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -j 4
    make install
    cd ..

    # Install libzmq
    git clone https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq
    cd libzmq
    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -j 4
    make install
    cd ..

    # Build CZMQ again...
    cd czmq
    ./configure && make -j 4
    make install
    cd ..

    Compiled my first zero mq program:

    $ gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello -L/usr/local/lib -lzmq 

    $ ./hello

    hello: error while loading shared libraries: libzmq.so.5: 
    cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

    Found a solution here: 

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17275875/zmq-libzmq-so-3-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-such-file-or-directory

    $ sudo ldconfig

    This will update the system library cache. I had already successfully built
    libzmq and libsodium.

    It took a couple of hours for the total compile/make times, but it is worth
    it to have zero mq installed in my raspberry pi! On my Mac it has not
    successfully been built though due to libzmq build cannot find libsodium...
    Maybe another time in Mac. Pi for now!

    Taken from  
    Compiling SDL with gcc on Mac (c code):
    
    get the linking flags:

    $ sdl-config --cflags --libs

    Which outputs:
    -I/opt/local/include/SDL -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_THREAD_SAFE -L/opt/local/lib 
    -lSDLmain -lSDL -Wl,-framework,Cocoa 

    So do this to compile:

    $ gcc -Wall -c main.c -o main.o
    $ gcc -I/opt/local/include/SDL -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_THREAD_SAFE 
      -L/opt/local/lib -lSDLmain -lSDL -Wl,-framework,Cocoa  main.o -o c_only

        This is a talk from Golang conference UK about security which I should
        still review:

            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViBRx-F4Z2U&list=PLDWZ5uzn69ezRJYeWxYNRMYebvf8DerHd

        This is linked from a link from: 

            https://blog.golang.org/

        The blog itself is a very good and is good morning material.

        Anyway, the security talk. The resource person, Eleanor McHugh has a
        book, "A Go Developer's Notebook" which is a great 
        study-by-hacking-snippets-of-code and putting in in my 
        ~/my_go/src/snippets, running, modifying and readig the thankfully short
        but very enlightening explanations from a hacker's collection of code
        snippets used in her talks through the years. The book can be bought
        from $6.00 to $24.00 at https://leanpub.com/GoNotebook. Great!

    Downloaded an older version as I have an older Mac and OSX.

    $ tar xzf redis-....

    $ cd redis...

    $ make

    $ cd src

    Ran server:

    $ ./redis_server

    Ran client:

    $ ./redis_cli

    After some tinkering, I shutdown both client and server and my work was
    saved. This seems to be a good alternative to sqlite for my needs. It has
    lists, hashes, sets.

    The append-only file is an alternative, fully-durable strategy for Redis. 
    Edit redis.conf (usually in /etc/redis/redis.conf) if redis is installed.

    Finally solved the "undefined" errors on go. 

    $ go build -o {name}

    I had to re-install go with brew:

    $ brew install git go

    I ended up with a colorized git though.

    I do not care what happened to other installations. My golang installation
    runs and my git is colorized. Cool!

    Had to set $GOROOT(/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.4.2/libexec) and $GOPATH 
    (/Users/me/go).

    Calling "go run" is good for only one file, use "go build" for multiple
    files. Easier than building in C.

    To make go and vim environment rock, I enabled pathogen in vim, by adding
    "pathogen infect()" something in .vim/vimrc. It only works in my account
    and not root, but at this time I just want to code go in a non root account
    anyway so it works. Got the vim-go pathogen by following something from
    here: http://blog.gopheracademy.com/vimgo-development-environment/ . 
    Actually only these 2 lines:

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git
    
    I had to create "bundle" directory and another one. 

    Vim and go at work. 

    One caveat: everytime I save in vim, it autoformats which is great, but
    the vim "undo" feature goes only to the last save. So what I do now is
    to use git to commit (not even push to a server) and then I can do all
    my rollbacks from there. The good thing with git is that every commit
    will have a description. I can plan better and get to learn to use git
    more effectively now.

    Taken from http://etodd.io/2015/09/28/one-weird-trick-better-code/:

    In summary, design data structures to match your specific problem. Don't 
    shoehorn a single concept into a bunch of separate, encapsulated objects.

    Next, write functions that leave the smallest possible footprint on that 
    data. If possible, write pure stateless functions.  

    That's the trick.

    Lesson learned: When studying from a book with code, code only from one
    place and have bookmarks only on one place of where your reading progress
    is. Not being able to keep track wanes interest. Keep track of progress
    so you can go on. This is what I will do now. Forgive myself for being
    sidetracked, but get the hell started again. Go on my OpenBSD is not so
    cool as I need root right now. I do not have the time to figure out how
    to configure it correctly so to hell with it. Start reading and coding. I
    will do JUST THAT! I will enjoy  the book now please. Dump the too techie
    stuff. In this case configuration is killing my learning. So just get rid
    of configuration problems and just code away.

    Bought the book Go Programming Blueprints. I decided to just dive right in
    instead of getting stuck in internet tutorials or buying a beginner go book
    which can be very boring indeed. This book was a good choice. Dive right in.
    The author is also versed in TDD and that kind of stuff. "Modern" methodolo-
    gy, fun projects, practice by copying and tinkering with real code. Evolving
    small programs to be bigger and more functions. Understanding from the 
    explanation provided in the book.

    The only other resource I will use is the golang book in google which has
    small snippets...

    Installing go in OpenBSD 5.6:

        # export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/5.6/packages/i386/
        # pkg_add 

    Installed go 1.3...

        $ go version

    This got a lot of errors.

    Can be solved with:

        $ export GOPATH=/home/go
        $ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
        $ ulimit -n 512

    I read that working fast matters as the faster you finish something or you 
    expect to finish something, the less a barrier it will be to get it started
    and the less afraid you are to do it. So I created a directory to my current
    work to prevent having to try to remember what I was working on and then
    just get it done!

    Created a link to current work on C which is version 0.01 of git.

        $ ln -s study/git_study/git-0.01-src/ current_work

    To remove the link I could just do:

        $ rm current_work

    To go to the current work just:

        $ cd current_work

Fri Aug  7 14:32:47 EDT 2015

    I have been thinking a lot during the last shift of my main job of 3. I am
    already doing 3 jobs. I do not earn enough to be really financially free as
    although I earn more, I have a bit more expenses to cover to be able to do
    3 jobs like: 2 cars now instead of 1 and I had to buy a relatively newer van
    to replace our old van for the family, but this is an investment in my
    family's happiness. The second car will just let me go to other jobs or 
    appointments. It also gives me more freedom. Thus, both cars are an invest-
    ment. Two new phones and upgraded Julia's. So we now have 3 phones with all
    unlimited text and messaging. Also all needed to be able to communicate more
    with family and for working relations, finding jobs, Kenken's phone to keep
    his job and got him a little more freedom, which he needs and deserves. All
    again pluses.

    I figured out that once these all get paid up then I will have some wiggle
    room to help out the kids for school. I will also soon have to increase
    savings.

    With all this figured out, I then decided. Time to get started with my 
    dream of getting a tech/learning/programming group started. Sir Brizo will
    be a good resource. That is why I bought a cana kit raspberry pi. I will
    ship it on Saturday to Bohol and get this thing started.

    Lastly. I am getting a rhythm of getting my "paperwork" done. Managing more.
    Time to make a pact with myself. First 30 minutes and last 30 minutes of the
    day should be spent on writing and coding.

    Now getting the error:

        warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'strpy'

    This also includes sprintf, strlen.....

    Solved this by adding #include <string.h> in cache.h.

    Now the whole thing compiles fine excluding a warning by the compiler to use
    snprintf() instead of sprintf() or strlcpy() instead of strcpy(). This might
    be something of an exercise next time, but the thing compiles. It's alive!

    Copying git-1.8.1-rc2 from my Mac to the BSD machine:

    Might as well start somewhere.

    Whoa! Able to compile git source 0.01 by including the proper libraries in
    Makefile. It has compiled successfully in my OpenBSD machine!

    In my Makefile:

    LIBS= -lssl -lcrypto -lz

    program_name: program_name.o
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o program_name program_name.o $(LIBS)


    -lcrypto will include SHA and other cryptographic stuff it seems
    -lz will include zlib.

    Notice that $(LIBS) is placed at the end of the line (CC) line.


    Found a resource in www.zlib.net/zlib_howto.html and will run the sample
    program using "deflate()" and "inflate()" methods which gave the error:

    Working on my Mac for a couple of days now for coding and recording entries.
    My BSD machine seems clunky nowadays especially as I had even more trouble
    trying to compile the git source code (version 0.01) on it. I might as well
    just program in Mac.

    The reason I am coding is an article from news.ycombinator.com about Elixir.
    I need to give this a try. And then work on the git source code and other
    projects.

    Installing Elixir:
    
    $ brew update
    $ brew install elixir

    ... now it is installing libtool, makedepend, openssl, libtiff, wxmac, jpeg,
    libpng, .... hung up...

    Unable to install Elixir. Back to C and Go coding. This sort of sucks.

    One week since the end of my Eddy VNA training ended... 7 weeks of hardcore
    schedules. Survived.

    April 17, 2015 - June 7, 2015. About 2 months of programming and journaling
    hiatus. A little bit of a rest. What I have been doing: 3 jobs, working out
    in the morning and tennis. I have to get into 5 minute journaling everyday
    and 5 minute coding also. Read 5 minutes. That makes 15 minutes of my day
    to programming and journaling. Sounds good enough. I can concentrate for 5
    minutes at a time. It will not eat all my day. 5 minute programmer. That is
    what I will be for now......

    FOLLOW UP:
    5 minutes journaling is great - just enough for quick entries
    5 minutes coding - if reading a bit then two 5-minute bursts works
            ( has to be short code though )
    5 minute reading......

    Well, that is it for now.

    One week of grueling 6/6:30 AM to 7/8 PM work. 6 - 7 at the nursing home and

    luck to me. I sit all morning for training and am glad when I go to the

    I have decided that using vim-tmux for development might just be the best
    option for me right now rather than learning EMACS. I read something about
    Linus' development habits and he is said to change machines something like
    twice a year, wants a Linux distro that is easy to install and works out of
    the box, has not used Debian (I don't know if he has already today), created
    the kernel but says he might not be any good programming in "user space", 
    uses pine to check email and uses micro emacs only (with his tweaks) to 
    do development.

    This shows that Linus just wants to get to coding most of the time and not
    be bogged down with configuring systems - I had configuration nightmares 
    before that is why I left rails (setting up the libraries even with RVM at
    one time took too much of my time. I am not going to mess with that again.

    This will be the new mantra:
    > go near the computer
    > setup environment in less than 5 minutes (from scratch if everything is
      turned off) less than 1 minute of server is open... 
      Setup should include opening logs, journals, todos
    > CODE, music, code

    That is why this is my new setup:
    > standing "desk" room dresser with big mirror (clean table top)
    > OpenBSD development machine/server sitting at a corner downstairs on a
      standing desk in case I want to code there. (takes up less than 4 feet
      by 4 feet corner space without cluttering the view in the living room.
      The OpenBSD machine is like a sculpture.
    > Macbook Intel (older) plugged in and on the standing desk by room 
      dresser (easy to copy and paste links from this machine), have one
      Firefox browser open and two iTerm windows open (one ssh to BSD and 
      the other open to the local files that I have developed on this machine,
      mostly C now, some Python. 
    > Samsung Alpha phone with Pandora open (Linkin, S.U.N. project, etc) to
      keep the juices flowing. Email (gmail) and youtube accessed only through
      this gadget as it has faster internet, smaller screen (reminding me that
      email and youtube take lower precedence to programming on my Mac which
      has a bigger screen, but now a sometimes choppy internet connection.

    Evertime a coding session is done, I close my Macbook and tuck it in a
    corner, put any book in my bookshelf downstairs, unplug my phone if it is
    charging (tuck charger in its place), and maybe just close the "lid" of
    my BSD machine to put it into hibernate. My BSD machine will always be
    plugged in with a tmux session always open. 

    It is still nice to know that the BSD machine is still my central dev 
    machine which I can carry and charge with a very common Lenovo charger
    which I even have at work. 

    The music as whitenoise works for me too.

    Got the DES encryption with OpenSSL: example in C to run. 
    Code was gladly taken from: 

    http://www.codealias.info/technotes/des_encryption_using_openssl_a_simple_example

    It had this line:

    #include <openssl/des.h>

    The code sample instructions for compilation given was:

    $ gcc test.c -o test -lssl

    I had a bunch of errors after compling as mentioned above. It finally
    compiled with -lcrypto

    $ gcc test.c -o test -lssl -lcrypto

    Finished work @ 4:11 PM, went home, cooked pre dinner meal for family, 
    listening to Pandora / Linkin Park radio.

    openbsd.txt now has:
    
    baloi@192.168.0.21 

    Can ssh to OpenBSD machine. Cool! Trying to figure out DES encryption from
    GNU C library or OpenBSD/SSL. Trouble compiling BSD, still trying to figure
    this out. 

    already tried:

    $ gcc -Wall -o open_encrypt open_encrypt.c -lssl

    This produces "undefined reference" stuff though. Lots of it...

    Waiting for my encryption book to arrive. I might just end up hard coding
    all of it myself. Hope I have the energy even just to type everything from
    the book. Maybe just DES, which could end up to be a few hundred or k 
    lines.

    SOLVED !! Compile like this:

    $ gcc -Wall -o open_encrypt open_encrypt.c -lssl -lcrypto

    (Need -lcrypto)

    Working and typing on the laptop keyboard from ottomans seem an ok position.
    It remains to be seen. Working out too.

    This will be the new programming setup. Just a laptop or a notebook, a radio
    and nothing else. Not even a calendar. They will all be at least 5 feet
    away. I will have my 8 x 8 feet of space to maneuver. Nothing readable in my
    corner. This works. The only thing that seems to right now. Give me this
    breathing space please.

    Maybe it should not just be close to a wall, but just a blank wall in front
    of you. This works. This definitely works.

    From Anteriz weblog (http://antirez.com/news/88): 

    "It is a few months that I spend ~ 15-20% of my time, mostly hours stolen to
    nights and weekends, working to a new system...."

    This is an eye opener for me. I am now earning enough money to support my
    family starting to save up for investment. I will invest time to get ready
    when enough money is there to build or nurture something.

    If I work at least 40-50 hours per week, I should have 8-10 hours for my
    side project. 8 hours seems good. 1 hour per day and then 4 hours in the 
    weekends...

    This is my new goal.

    be a reason not to go into emacs.

    Just 1 day more than a month after I've had this OpenBSD installation on my
    older Lenovo Thinkpad which I put alongside my oldish "more media" Macbook
    and I have learned a few things. Configured network, install/update driver
    for my wireless USB, have a console-only machine. Fun, fun, fun!


    It seems that the default shell for OpenBSD is the Korn shell /bin/ksh.
    
    The creator of Redis wrote that for the six years of developing Redis, he
    had quite a few side projects himself to keep his "juices flowing". Some-
    thing to break the monotony of one project, one code base. Distractions,
    scratching an itch. This is it.

    Now to figure out ksh....

    Downloaded vividchalk.vim using lynx. Then installed zip and unzip:
    # pkg_add -r zip
    # pkg_add -r unzip

    No long-lasting headache since the 14th of February. Went on a week-long
    vacation 2/16-2/20/15 in Maryland Ocean City Hilton and Edroi's place in
    Frederick Maryland. Slept always by 9 or 10 PM. Ate well and not too often.
    A good vacation, although the new used car's AC had wrecked my airways. Had
    an asthma attack during the whole week, but was semi-manageable.

    Another possible headache cause would be the lack of sleep and the very late
    vigorous exercise.

================================================================================

Sat Feb 14 11:56:26 EST 2015

    I had another long-lasting headache yesterday (Friday). I went to the Y the
    day before and did the heated pool and sauna. I then did my kettlebell cycle
    11:30 - 12 am. I was not able to sleep early. It was also cold that night.
    Still cannot pinpoint the cause of the headache. Waiting for my Odyssey van
    to be ready today hopefully.

================================================================================

Wed Feb 11 23:42:59 EST 2015

    Worked out with kettlebells (basics of snatch - swing, getup, clean, press)
    some long cycle presses then finished with 4 rounds of kettlebell swings
    @35 lbs (30 sec with 60 sec rests). Enough to counter today's sitting at the
    wheel (driving) or so I hope.

    Working out with music helps though (S.U.N. project or similar).

    Workout was done after I finished my notes on Janjan's fast computer - 
    sweet !

================================================================================

Wed Feb 11 06:20:16 EST 2015

    Will work at 6:30 AM at Barnwell then 9 am at Ferncliff, back to Barnwell

    Follow up ( 11:40 PM ):
    * Worked @ 6:45 - 9 AM
      Ferncliff 10:05 - 5:45 PM

    A stall on coding and even slowed down on workouts due to 2nd job just 
    started. First week of second job done. Tapering down now. Figured out that
    I just have to start at about 6 am and I must be ok....

    Now for my workout....

    Just about done cooking dinner with Julia. Made re-baked chicken and minced
    cacciatori. We just also came home from YMCA and ALDI. We were waived the 
    fee for membership of $100 and this month is pro-rated at $40, it will be
    $88 next month. We will be able to reimbursed by our Blue Cross insurance.

    At the Y, I first played rebounder for the kids at the basketball court, 
    lifted a few kettlebell presses and did a lunge, pushup, run circuit at the
    track for about 3 rounds. Got me breathing harder. I then finished with the
    hot whirlpool and almost 10 minutes at the sauna. Really hot. Got me sweat-
    ing. Stress relief.

    Superbowl Sunday!

    Maybe having python on my OpenBSD machine will be "too much tech". A little
    history of programming languages by year from Wikipedia:

    1968 - Logo
    1969 - B (forerunner to C)
    1970 - Pascal
    1970 - Forth

    1972 - C
    1972 - Smalltalk
    1972 - Prolog

    1973 - ML
    1975 - Scheme
    1978 - SQL

    1980 - C++
    1983 - Ada
    1984 - Common Lisp

    1984 - MATLAB
    1985 - Eiffel
    1986 - Objective-C
    1986 - Erlang
    1987 - Perl

    1988 - Tcl
    1988 - Mathematica
    1989 - FL (Backus)

    Of these, I want be stuck in the 70's when C was relevent and still is 
    today. Maybe a sprinkle of some other tech here and there.

    I keep thinking how 70's and 80's programmers, especially 70's kept the
    coding fire burning. Maybe with good tape recorded music.

    For me now: a headphone and a good playlist at medium loud.

    I am currently using tmux on my OpenBSD terminal to be my "window manager".
    It does not get any sweeter than this. Pure text bliss. Everything is text.
    This is one way of looking at programming also, especially if you work with
    languages like C or Python. Open file, open socket, read file, read bytes
    from stream, write to file, search through lists, arrays, files, etc...

    Text processing in the modern world. 

    I still have my MacBook at my side for music and "eye candy" or to have any
    distraction. Keep distractions on another machine or even a tablet. 
    Internet for my BSD machine will be for git, ssh and scp. Should I remove
    lynx then? Yes, I just did.

        # pkg_delete lynx

    Making wireless usb work:

        Connect to internet and update firmware:
        # fw_update
            // Cool! this updated wpi and urtwn

        Configure network

        # ifconfig urtwn0 scan      // gets the nwid (network id)
        # ifconfig urtwn0 nwid "network-id" wpakey "passkey"
        # dhclient urtwn0           // or dhclient wpi0 if urtwn0 configured as
                                    // above

    Git configure
        Generate ssh key and then copy to Mac
        $ cd .ssh
        $ scp id_rsa.pub user@ip_address://Users/username/directory

        Init repo
        $ git remote add origin git@github.com:baloi/repository_name.git
        $ git push -u origin master

    THIS WORKS!! Will now sleep happily...

    Error setting up wifi:

    ERROR:
        failed to load firmware urtwn0 urtwn18192cfwT

    This error came up when trying to do:
        # dhclient urtwn0
    
    But I only found this error in dmesg:

        # dmesg | tail

    That is after I still could not connect to wifi even after all the 
    configuration I tried alread. It got a bit bloody. I had to read the man
    pages which actually was very helpful. A person I worked who used to own an
    ISP and still works with Linux told me to try "ifconfig" and go from there.
    He specifically said to try ifconfig and read the man page. Duh! 

    I am sometimes tempted to read stuff from the internet before referring to
    the man pages so I get bits and pieces of things and sometimes miss the big
    picture.

    Having a barebones machine has enabled me to look at the system and its
    internals more now. I even downloaded the OpenBSD source and tinkered with
    "ed" the line editor's source code. From running make I learned how to 
    compile multiple c files with the "-c" option to first make the object files
    then try something like:

        $ gcc -Wall -o program routines.o another_object.o main.c

    Now to read the gcc man pages....

    Man pages say running gcc with the "-c" option tells gcc not to do linking,
    so the output will be object files output by the assembler.

    Warning: GCC man page spits out a LOT OF STUFF.

    "When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly
    and linking. " - man pages for gcc

    Working out. Started at 9:50 PM. Stretched hips and shoulders. 2 rounds of
lifts now. Amazon music on. Slowly lowering volume of music and TV. Getting 
pumped also about my coding...

    Main function in main.c of link_list data structure project. Have structure
templates ready with function pointers for possible struct functions...

    I now have to figure out how to test and implement these functions. Then
eventually use this linked list to store some items...

    Eventually did 3 rounds of strengthening exercises....

    Created local git repository for my tinkering with containers in C:

      * Create 'git' user
      * Login as git, make project directory and then initialize directory

        $ mkdir containers.git
        $ cd containers.git
        $ git init --bare

      * Login as your user and clone bare repo

        $ cd ~/working/
        $ git clone git@localhost:/home/baloi/git/containers.git
        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m 'first commit'

    After downloading the OpenBSD source code, I checked out the bin directory
and surprised to find directories for the commands like cat, cp, chmod, date,
dd, ln, ls, md5, ps, rm, even ed!

    Go into directory like ed and just issue command:
        
        $ make

    Or it seems we can just compile eachline with:
        
        $ cc -02 -pipe -DBACKWARDS -c filename.c
          ....
          # do for all c files

Personal Jesus, Gonna Make You Sweat(Everybody ), The Power (Snap).
    Had a good dinner (shrimp, pork ribs menudo with atay, and pork curry. Also
cleaned some dishes with Janjan. Janjan regularly washes dishes. Bless him.

    I finished work and went to Hannaford with Julia and Kenken. Spent $43 plus
Julia spent $15 on more food from Stewarts. More extra expenses. Good thing we
have something in the bank, but extra stuff has to be tapered starting now. 

    Going to work out in 5 minutes. Planning to do 30-45 minutes. Having a cut-
off for workouts is good so I know how to allot time for the task.
    Going now!

        This will be my log of what I have done with my BSD machine. I just 
installed this from my flash drive by doing the following:

  * downloaded install56.fs the OpenBSD website

  * erased contents of a flash drive using GUI diskutil

  * use command line diskutil to get current list of devices
    $  diskutil list

       // my flash drive was /dev/disk1

  * unmount flash drive
    $ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1

  * wrote install56.fs to disk
    $ sudo dd if=install56.fs of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m

        // Note that using /dev/rdiskN instead of /dev/diskN may be faster

  * eject
    $ diskutil eject /dev/disk1

  * restart machine you want to install OpenBSD. Make sure that your flash drive 
is plugged in during boot.

        // Note: 
        //      Installation was easy and added user. Did not connect to the
        //      internet yet. This will be for the second install. gcc was 
        //      installed by default with vi also - makes it good. I just could 
        //      not find the sources yet. Maybe sources are not installed by 
        //      default. Installation took much less than 30 minutes. Felt like 
        //      10 minutes.

        Currently only vi and not vim is installed. No syntax highlighting, no
        auto complete, no expandtab, no retab. Bare bones. No Python even.

        Am I in trouble or what? "!!date command in vi works though for 
        timestamping so I am doing something right.
